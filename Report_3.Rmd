# Info813 report week 3: Cluster analysis on dissmilarities among organizations

## Question statement

1. What cluster method would you use to analyze the data?
2. Interpret the result.

## Data description

The data was claimed to be collected by John Johns about the dissimilarities among 30 different organizations. Informants were asked to rate the dissimilarities of a pair of organization. The dataset is a symmetric 30 x 30 dissimilarity matrix, a part of which is presented below.

``` {R}

output[1:5, 1:5]

```

## Research method

Agglomerative and partitioning clustering methods were used in this report. The clustering methods were also evaluated.

In order to determine the modality of the dataset, a scatter plot matrix was plotted below. Because of the large number of variables in the dataset, only a part of the scatter plots was presented. In sum, there doesn't seem to be strong unimodality in this dataset.

``` {R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = F, warning = F}

pairs(~o1 + o2 + o3 + o4 + o5, data= output)

```

A heatmap based on the dataset was plotted below. Disregarding the dendrogram, there seems to be three clusters in this dataset.

``` {R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = F, warning = F}

heatmap(output)

```

All the distances were calculated using Euclidean method.

``` {R echo = F, warning = F}

org.dist <- dist(output, method = "euclidean")

```

## Results

#### Agglomerative clustering

The dendrogram of the dataset using Euclidean method was plotted below. Combining with the heatmap shown above, the three-cluster solution seems to best describe the dataset.

``` {R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = F, warning = F}

## Agglomerative

org.hclust = hclust(org.dist, method = "centroid")
plot(org.hclust)
rect.hclust(org.hclust, k = 3)

```

However, two-cluster solution could also work on a different level.

``` {R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, echo = F, warning = F}

## Agglomerative

org.hclust = hclust(org.dist, method = "ward.D")
plot(org.hclust)
rect.hclust(org.hclust, k = 2)

```

#### Partitioning

Following what we have known, a K-mean method was used with K = 3. And as comparison, the K-mean plot with K = 2 was plotted below. Below is the result. It is not surprising that all the observations were classified into the same group with agglomerative and partitioning methods.

``` {R fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10, echo = F, warning = F}

## Partitioning

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
fit <- kmeans(output, 3)
fit_2 <- kmeans(output, 2)
clusplot(output, fit$cluster, main = "K-mean plot with 3 clusters")
clusplot(output, fit_2$cluster, main = "K-mean plot with 2 clusters")

```

#### Evaluation of the results

In order to determine if the 3-cluster solution is significantly better than the 2-cluster solution (and 4-cluster and 5-cluster solutions), pseudo-F statistic was calculated below. Because the 3-cluster solution's pseudo-F value is much higher than 2-cluster solution, it could support the conclusion that 3-cluster solution is a better one in terms of the within-group heterogeneity.

``` {R echo = F, warning = F}

group_3 <- cutree(org.hclust, 3)
group_2 <- cutree(org.hclust, 2)
group_4 <- cutree(org.hclust, 4)
group_5 <- cutree(org.hclust, 5)

f_3 <- calinhara(org.dist, group_3)
f_2 <- calinhara(org.dist, group_2)
f_4 <- calinhara(org.dist, group_4)
f_5 <- calinhara(org.dist, group_5)

f_table <- data.frame(c("2-cluster", "3-cluster", "4-cluster", "5-cluster"), c(f_2, f_3, f_4, f_5))
colnames(f_table) <- c("Solution", "pseudo-F value")
pander(f_table)

```

In terms of the withinness of the clusters, Silhouette plot were used to evaluate the results 2 to 5-cluster solutions. Below is the Silhouette plot for 3-cluster solution.

``` {R echo = F, warning = F, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 8}

pam.3 <- pam(output, k = 3)
plot(pam.3, main = "Silhouette plot for 3-cluster solution")

```

In Silhouette plot, the higher the average silhouette width is, the better all the objects lie within each cluster. According to the results, 3-cluster solution, again, is the better one, even though the difference is marginal.

``` {R echo = F, warning = F}

## PAM cluster

result <- pamk(output, krange = 2:5)

sil_table <- data.frame(c("2-cluster", "3-cluster", "4-cluster", "5-cluster"), c(result$crit[2], result$crit[3], result$crit[4], result$crit[5]))
colnames(sil_table) <- c("Solution", "Average sihouette width")
pander(sil_table)

```

A validation method about betweenness is to compare the between sum of squares / total sum of squares, which the percentage of total variance that is explained by the cluster. Below is the summary of this number from 2 to 5-cluster solutions.

``` {R echo = F, warning = F}

fit.4 <- kmeans(output, 4)
fit.5 <- kmeans(output, 5)

stat_table <- data.frame(c("2-cluster", "3-cluster", "4-cluster", "5-cluster"),
                         c(fit_2$betweenss / fit_2$totss, fit$betweenss / fit$totss, fit.4$betweenss / fit.4$totss, fit.5$betweenss / fit.5$totss))
colnames(stat_table) <- c("Solution", "Percentage of total variance")
pander(stat_table)

```

## Conclusion

It is shown by this report that in terms of this dataset, agglomerative and partitioning methods do not make much difference. Pretty much identical results were generated using these two methods.

What matters is the number of clusters. By ignoring an obvious cluster, the 2-cluster solution has about the same level of withinness from other solutions, but a much lower level of betweenness. However, the best solution, the 3-cluster solution, doesn't have significant difference from 4- and 5-cluster solutions in both withinness and betweenness.
